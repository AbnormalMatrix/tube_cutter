# Tube Cutter

  

**Tube Cutter** is a lightweight CAM application written in Rust for generating and running G-code to cut square (and round) tubing using a CNC plasma cutter. It includes direct serial communication with the cutter.

  ## âœ¨ Features
  * Generate grblHAL compatible G-codes that can cut straight lines.
  * Calculate cuts based on given angles.
  * Basic serial connection to machines.

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals

- [ ] **Realtime Toolhead Updates** - Monitor the live position of your CNC toolhead.
- [ ] **Simulation Mode** - Preview G-code paths before sending them to the machine
- [ ] **Tube Notching Support** - Design cut paths for square and round tubing
